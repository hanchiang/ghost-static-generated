We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.</p><p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost">community</a>.</p><h2 id="next-up-the-editor">Next up, the editor</h2><p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href="https://yaphc.com/the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>.

While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.</p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.</p><hr><h1 id="invite-your-team">Invite your team </h1><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><p>Next up: <a href="https://yaphc.com/organising-content/">Organising your content</a> </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Organising your content]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags which can be used to configure your site structure using dynamic routing.]]></description><link>https://yaphc.com/organising-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bdadbacd084681695d281e6</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 10:55:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://casper.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/organising-your-content.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/organising-your-content.jpg" alt="Organising your content"><p>Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called<strong> tags</strong> which can be used to configure your site structure using <strong>dynamic routing</strong>. </p><h1 id="basic-tagging">Basic Tagging</h1><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with  News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/weather/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Weather</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h1 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h1><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h1 id="private-tags">Private tags</h1><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://themes.ghost.org/v2.0.0/docs">theme documentation</a>.</em></blockquote><h1 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic Routing</h1><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>For example, you may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> . </p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/docs/dynamic-routing">documentation</a> for further details.</em></blockquote><p>You can further customise your site using <a href="https://yaphc.com/apps-integrations/">Apps &amp; Integrations</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apps & integrations]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.]]></description><link>https://yaphc.com/apps-integrations/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bdadbacd084681695d281e4</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 10:55:41 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://casper.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" alt="Apps & integrations"><p>There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.</p><h1 id="zapier">Zapier</h1><p>You can connect your Ghost site to over 1,000 external services using the official integration with <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p><p>Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.</p><blockquote><strong>Example</strong>: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).</blockquote><p><strong>Here are the most popular Ghost&lt;&gt;Zapier automation templates:</strong> </p><script src="https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8"></script>
<h1 id="editing-your-theme">Editing your theme</h1><p>One of the biggest advantages of using Ghost over centralised platforms is that you have total control over the front end of your site. Either customise your existing theme, or create a new theme from scratch with our <a href="https://themes.ghost.org">Theme SDK</a>. </p><p>You can integrate <em>any</em> front end code into a Ghost theme without restriction, and it will work just fine. No restrictions!</p><p><strong>Here are some common examples</strong>:</p><ul><li>Include comments on a Ghost blog with <a href="https://help.ghost.org/article/15-disqus">Disqus</a> or <a href="https://help.ghost.org/article/35-discourse">Discourse</a></li><li>Implement <a href="https://help.ghost.org/article/89-mathjax">MathJAX</a> with a little bit of JavaScript</li><li>Add syntax highlighting to your code snippets using <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a></li><li>Integrate any dynamic forms from <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/">Google</a> or <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a> to capture data</li><li>Just about anything which uses JavaScript, APIs and Markup.</li></ul><h1 id="using-the-public-api">Using the Public API</h1><p>Ghost itself is driven by a set of core APIs, and so you can access the Public Ghost JSON API from external webpages or applications in order to pull data and display it in other places.</p><blockquote>The Ghost API is <a href="https://api.ghost.org">thoroughly documented</a> and straightforward to work with for developers of almost any level. </blockquote><p>Alright, the last post in our welcome-series!

However, as the application grows, console.log gets littered everywhere. Also, there is formatting messaging is done manually.</p>
<h2 id="introducingbunyan">Introducing bunyan</h2>
<p>A nice little logging tool that comes with time stamp, process ID and machine name formatting out of the box.</p>
<p>Take a look out <a href="https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan">bunyan</a> here.</p>
<h3 id="usingbunyan">Using bunyan</h3>
<p><strong>1. Install bunyan</strong><br>
<code>npm install bunyan</code></p>
<p><strong>2. Create a logger instance</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    const bunyan = require('bunyan');
    const log = bunyan.createLogger({
        name: 'my-logger',
        serializers: bunyan.stdSerializers
    })
    
    module.exports = log;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Logging methods</strong><br>
There are several methods for logging such as <em>info</em>, <em>warn</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>debug</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4. View output</strong><br>
<code>[2018-10-29T10:04:08.045Z] INFO: my-logger/20194 on : Express is running on port 3000</code></p>
<h3 id="optionalprettyprint">Optional: Pretty print</h3>
<p>Bunyan has a useful tool for pretty printing the logs into a more human readable format via CLI: <code>node index.js | ./node_modules/.bin/bunyan</code></p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Bunyan is a nice tool that comes with great formatting for logging in production. It is easy to get started with, however customising its behaviour is not easy as the documentation isn't well organised to facilitate this.</p>

<img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/11/mongodb-logo.png" alt="Managing connections in MongoDB"><p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows us to store data in other formats such as object, document, graph other than tabular relations using relational databases. As it is designed for horizontal scaling, NoSQL is increasingly used in applications that handle a huge volume of data, and real-time analytics.</p>
<p>Personally, I am using MongoDB out of interest, to learn a new technology and apply it to in my own side project. Like others, I followed tutorials and courses which used mongoose, a Object Document Mapper for MongoDB, to abstract nitty-gritty details away to provide a streamlined learning experience to new developers.</p>
<p>However, this time, I am using the <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/" target="_blank">native driver</a>, in an attempt to learn to use the actual MongoDB syntax and commands.<br>
So, the very first roadblock that I faced is to manage the connections, which mongoose already takes good care of.</p>
<h2 id="managingmongodbconnections">Managing MongoDB connections</h2>
<p>A quick research on StackOverflow and other websites suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to MongoDB when the app starts</li>
<li>Reuse the connection whenever the route handlers need to connect to the database</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds pretty simple. The next question I had in mind was: What is a good way to do this?</p>
<p>Another quick search showed a few approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to and store the MongoDB instance in <strong>req</strong> via an application level middleware before hitting the route handlers</li>
<li>Connect to MongoDB and pass the instance to the route handlers, which does so by exporting a function</li>
<li>Connect to MongoDB and store the instance. Route handlers and controllers that need access to the database will retrieve the instance</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="approach1storingmongodbinstanceinrequest">Approach 1: Storing MongoDB instance in request</h3>
<p>This approach is the easiest to implement.<br>
Set up a middleware that connects to the database, store the database instance in the request object, and use it in the route handlers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/floatdrop/express-mongo-db/blob/master/index.js" target="_blank">express-mongo-db</a> provides an example of how to do this.</p>
<p>However, I found out via StackOverflow that it might not be a good idea to expose library codes in an object.</p>
<h3 id="approach2passittoroutehandlers">Approach 2: Pass it to route handlers</h3>
<p>This approach is detailed by <a href="https://blog.mlab.com/2017/05/mongodb-connection-pooling-for-express-applications/" target="_blank">mLab</a>, one of the most popular MongoDB cloud providers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup up the connections in a config file and export the database instances.</li>

        // Note: A production application should not expose database credentials in plain text.
        // For strategies on handling credentials, visit 12factor: https://12factor.net/config.
        const PROD_URI = "mongodb://:@:,:/?replicaSet="
        const MKTG_URI = "mongodb://:@:,:/?replicaSet="

        function connect(url) {
          return MongoClient.connect(url).then(client => client.db())

        const routes = require('./routes')

        initializeDatabases().then(dbs => {
          // Initialize the application once database connections are ready.
          routes(app, dbs).listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on port 3000'))

</pre>
<p>Even though this approach works, it won't be as clean for my case as my route controllers are defined in its own file, not in the route handler itself. Therefore, one additonal hoop is needed to apss the database instance.</p>

<p>These approaches achieve a common goal: To create a single connection instance that allows it to be reused.</p>
<p>The third approach does this in the simplest way that follows proper coding practices.</p>

<p>This is the code for my pie chart. I used the jQuery's selector to select my <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag, and call the <code>sparkline</code> function, passing in two arguments, an <strong>array</strong> of values and an <strong>object</strong> of options.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

    <figcaption>Code in Angular 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>1. Values</strong></p>
<p>Put the values to be displayed in an array, which is passed in as the first argument to the <code>sparkline</code> function</p>
<p><strong>2. Labels</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, put the labels for the data in an array, which is to be used later in the tooltip</p>
<p><strong>3. Tooltip</strong></p>
<p>We use the <code>tooltipFormat</code> option to format out tooltip, and <code>tooltipValueLookups</code> option to provide the label to be displayed in the tooltip.</p>
<p>Everything in the span tag is used to display a small circle with the colour of the element, specified in <code>sliceColors</code>.</p>
<p><code>offset</code> is used to display the label name in the tooltip</p>
<p><code>{{value}}</code> displays the value of the element</p>
<p><code>({{percent.1}})</code> displays the percentage with one decimal surrounded by parentheses.</p>
<p>Besides writing simple code, the ease of customisation of the tooltip is an added bonus which provides a good developer experience.</p>
