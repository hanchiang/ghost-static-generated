It started in late September 2018, and extended to mid February 2019.</p>
<p>In the first phase interviews from September to November 2018, I contacted around 6 companies and was shortlisted and accepted by one of them.</p>
<p>Generally, things went well and I was en route to start my first job some time in early January 2019 after a short probation at a company.<br>
But a situation cropped up and I decided to move on and continue my job search, which saw me applying to at around 20 more companies.</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since I was out of job.<br>
The urgency to find a job, coupled with the constant pressure from my parent to &quot;just get a job&quot; and &quot;don't be so fussy&quot; is slowly but surely getting to me.</p>
<p>However I paid no attention to it, which brings me to an exciting journey of even more interviews.</p>
<h2 id="thesecondphasethestormbeforethecalm">The second phase: the storm before the calm</h2>
<p>The second phase of interviews spans from January to mid February 2019, and was characterised by tremendous uncertainty and doubt.<br>
Rejections and ghosting became second nature to me quickly.</p>
<p>The frustration of going through the wildly varying software engineer interview processes at different companies showed me that it is important to what I am looking out for and the values I bring to the team.</p>
<p>I dropped them as soon as I detected red flags that I find it unacceptable to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a phone call just to ask me about my graduation date and github profile, which are stated in my resume</li>
<li>hiring manager who doesn't know what kind of team member he is looking for, such as trying to squeeze out as many programming languages out of an applicant as possible, like throwing a net, hoping to catch the biggest fish.</li>
<li>a continuation of the previous point: a hiring manager that hum and haws half the time, which certainly doesn't help to instill confidence in me that he is capable of building and leading a team of software engineers to achieve the business mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="levellingup">Levelling up</h2>
<p>All these trials are the lessons I needed to learn in order to be a better and well rounded person, to make a well-informed decision regarding career and life.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, I am glad I have learned to set my own standards, as well as having clarity about the value I bring to employers, instead of complaining about how life is unfair and giving up, or take the easy route to accept offers that I didn't find fulfilling and favourable.</p>
<p>If there is anything I learned from job hunting, it is to evaluate the company as much as they are evaluating me.<br>
Beyond the job description, learn as much about the hiring manager and business executives as possible.</p>
<h2 id="thelightattheendofthetunnel">The light at the end of the tunnel</h2>
<p>Finally, with some self-work and a little bit of luck, I managed to secure a job that I really wanted. I had great impression of the company and leadership, and am confident in levelling up myself by working for them.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I didn't quite see this coming and it would be easy to say that hard work always prevails with the clear lens of hindsight.</p>
<p>For now, it is an achievement unlocked and I am looking forward to unlock many more in the future!</p>

<p>In 20 May 2015, age 22, I purchased PRUflexicash, which was marketed as a savings plan to me to &quot;beat the bank's pathetic interest&quot; as well as possibly beat Singapore's inflation rate. Furthemore, I can choose the yearly 5% cashback option if needed(e.g. graduation trip).</p>
<h2 id="financialeducationlearnnoworpaylater">Financial education - learn now or pay later</h2>
<p>Today is the day I embarked on my own financial education and realised that this policy is actually a an endowment with an insurance component. Certain things that were unclear to me in the past are becoming more lucid now.<br>
For example, I couldn't understand why the guaranteed sum is only 57.5% of my principal amount, - Nani, isn't a savings account supposed to preserve my money???</p>
<p>After trawling through the policy document, I found the holy grail: <strong>&quot;PruFlexiCash is not a savings account&quot;</strong>.<br>
This phrase was found on 2 pages of the document. Sadly, I only remembered looking at some paragraphs in a few pages before signing 25 years away. <span class="ec ec-see-no-evil"></span></p>
<p>Also, the projected returns on the benefit illustration usually shows an optimistic projection, in reality the returns are lower. Furthermore, if I understood correctly, it shows the performance of the participating funds made by the company, not the actual returns that the policy holder can expect to receive.</p>
<p>A quick reading shows that putting money into a government-backed bond(Singapore savings bond) is better(in terms of liquidity, guaranteed principal) than an endowment plan for the purpose of &quot;saving&quot;, and the insurance component can be sorted out with a term policy.</p>
<h3 id="beingresponsible">Being responsible</h3>
<p>My opinion of the insurance industry is generally negative.</p>
<p>I believe that many financial consultants are unable to act in the best interests of their clients due to the inherent conflict of interest with the earning potential.</p>
<p>What may be seen as the best for the clients, such as products with lower commissions(term insurance) considerably lowers the FCs' income. Furthermore, it is not surprising that they are only trained on high commission products.</p>
<p>The standard protocol to close a deal is to draw a timeline and do a projection on the returns in X years, jump right into benefits illustration for a clearer picture, go through only the pages that requires the customer's signature while other pages are unimportant.<br>
I believe this is the main reason why many customers &quot;didnt read the terms properly&quot;, and come to regret it years later.</p>
<p>We could argue that the cow comes home, whether it is the failure on financial consultant's part to be fully transparent, the greed and ignorance of policy holders, or something in between.</p>
<p>The only real safeguard we need to have is to be able to handle the psychological and emotional pressure that many financial consultants exert on us when trying to convince us that everything is done in our best interest, not very different from people running MLM businesses in terms of the business model.<br>
The only commandment to follow is: If you don't understand something, don't buy it.</p>
<p>Since then I have learned from these experiences and am now competent in the department of defense against the dark arts. <span class="ec ec-shield"></span></p>

<h2 id="planwellknowledgeispower">Plan well - knowledge is power</h2>
<p>I believe that insurance is important to safeguard ourselves and our loved ones should unexpected incidents happen.<br>
The onus is on us to be educated in financial products by reading up and discussing with people in order to make informed decisions, and follow the golden rule of thumb: never buying anything you are unsure of.</p>
<p>In our information age, there are abundant discussion and analysis regarding financial products by finance professionals, bloggers, and other self-taught people. With this, we can more self-sufficient, responsible, and be aware of the things to look out for when encountering the &quot;real deal&quot;.<br>
With a variety of online brokerages available, investing is now more accessible to the layman.</p>
<h2 id="personalplansmovingahead">Personal plans moving ahead</h2>
<p>I am looking to get adequate insurance coverage(illnesses, death) and take savings and investments elsewhere(bonds, stocks).</p>
<p>I am also considering to surrender the endowment policy at the end of 4th year, getting around 50% of the 5k premium paid.<br>
A &quot;savings&quot; plan is supposed to be low risk, in my opinion a guaranteed returns of 57.5% of principal doesn't reflect that.<br>
I can swallow the loss of 2.5k, and treat it as a life lesson to be fully responsible for my own life(health, finance, fitness, whatever it is).</p>
<p>My main goal is to be in greater control of my own savings and investment dollars.<br>
I don't like the idea of locking up my money for 25 years, during which several incidents can and are likely to occur such as the financial consultant retiring after making enough, jumping ship to rival company.<br>
As a result, a new FC will be assigned, who has no incentive to provide financial advice because technically we are not their customer, and the cycle of being (hard)sold insurance products repeats again.</p>
<p>More often than not, the consumers are on the losing end. Therefore, I wish to remove these unnecessary burden and stress from saving and investing with insurance companies, and start out with low investment products such as government-backed bonds, stocks ETF.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it is about finding the right financial products to meet our needs. Just like I would visit a GP for acute injuries or problems, I wouldn't seek fitness advice from them, that's the playground of personal trainers. Similarly, I will get adequate insurance coverage from insurance companies, but won't put any dollar with them for wealth accumulation.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand the objectives of your financial planning.</li>
<li>Do the due diligence, get educated on the different types of financial products.</li>
<li>Understand what you buy. If unsure, don't buy(this is the best policy, honesty being second).</li>
<li>Do not mix insurance and investing.
<ul>
<li>But it might be suitable for people who wants absolutely no hassle in financial planning, and am able to deal with the possibility of a much different returns than what was projected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you can't manage your money, or can't be bothered to learn the basics, someone will tell you how to do so, and you may pay a price down the road - the bitterness of ignorance.</li>

<p>It all happened within a span of 4 days, from the initial report of the training injury to his passing.</p>
<p>It was so unreal to learn of this, especially that I used to watch the shows he acted in when I was a kid.</p>
<h2 id="thetimelessmilitarysafetydebate">The timeless military safety debate</h2>
<p>Furious discussions have been started in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore" target="_blank">r/Singapore </a> regarding the different permutations of scenarios that could caused this tragedy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fellow soldier's and commander's fault for not ensuring proper safety before operating equipment</li>
<li>Fellow soldier's and commander's fault for not getting the victim out of danger in due time</li>
<li>Victim's negligence for failing to follow safety procedure</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, none of us know the actual situation on ground, but we all know that it just takes one person to be &quot;out of sync&quot; for accidents to occur.</p>
<h2 id="movingon">Moving on</h2>
<p>With this high profile fatality, I hope that a complete investigation will be done, in which systemic processes are thoroughly reviewed to uncover possible lapses that could have led to serious incidents, instead of re-emphasizing on the importance individual safety.</p>
<p>Every military training related death is unacceptable and let's hope that this shall be the last.</p>
<h2 id="yolo">YOLO</h2>
<p>In light of recent such training related incidents, it just struck us as to how fragile and unpredictable our lives actually are.</p>
<p>People have reflected on their lives and believed that they should put all fear and inhibition behind and do whatever they please before they leave this place.</p>
<p>While that attitude is reasonable or even encouraged, I don't think we should just go all <em>YOLO</em> it out in reaction to intense emotional happenings, but rather to live every day of our lives purposefully.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Aloysius Pang.</p>

Whatever it is called, it is the lifeblood of programmers using a unix-based system.</p>
<p>My first encounter with the Z shell was during my internship in 2018 summer. My tech lead was troubleshooting some docker issues on my laptop and he remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bash sucks. Use z shell, it is so much better&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Every programmer's goal is to maximise productivity while minimising the amount of effort expended.</p>
<p>Without diving into the history of bash and Z shell, let's talk about some wins I have experienced in my workflow:</p>
<p><strong>cd tab autocomplete</strong><br>
For bash, the tab autocomplete shows a list of directories matching the current word, while Z shell allows me to cycle through the directory list with a double tab.</p>
<p>It is not a big deal when there is only one directory that matches the current word, but can save a tiny bit of time when there are multiple matches and the names are long.</p>

<h3 id="ohmyzsh">Oh my Zsh!</h3>
<p>We can't talk about Z shell without mentioning the awesome <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank">oh-my-zsh</a> framework, which comes with themes and plugins that supercharges the Z shell itself.</p>
<p>It is similar to jetpack from wordpress, which magically does a lot work for us.</p>
<p>In the words of oh-my-zsh's maintainers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you might feel like one</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>z command: smart cd based on history</strong><br>
Gone are the days when we have to manually <code>cd</code> or <code>Open in Terminal</code> in our working directory.</p>
<p>Just do a <code>z &lt;my_working_directory&gt;</code> and Z shell will (hopefully) get you to the destination in a jiffy. Not to mention that the command has a tolerance for typo error.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The path that we want to <code>z</code> into should be manually navigated to at least once, so that Z shell will &quot;remember&quot; it for future use.</p>

<p><strong>git branch no more</strong><br>
Let's take a moment to reflect on how much time was wasted by typing <code>git branch</code> in our entire lifetime.</p>
<p>With the <code>agnoster</code> theme, the current branch is clearly shown in the terminal.</p>

<p><strong>Autocomplete suggestion</strong><br>
Z shell is all about being lazy to save precious time, and this takes the cake because no one got the time to type in the same command more than once.</p>
<p>Autocomplete suggestions shows up as a muted gray color as we type the commands, and we just have to hit → to accept the suggestion.</p>

<img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2019/01/nightmare.jpg" alt="19 Jan 2018 - A bizarre dream"><p>I dreamt about killing two people in my life. I can't remember who they were, or what threats they posed to my life. The killing blow was delivered simply by a stab to their abdomen, and I walked away calmly as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Shortly after guilt and fear struck me, and I couldn't believe that someone like me who was brought up from a traditional family would actually commit a murder! In order to prolong my remaining days as a civilian, I avoided crowded places and people, discarded things that personally identify me.</p>
<p>But the emotional distress was too much to bear, and every moment was a living hell. So, putting aside my fear of human judgment, I poured out to my friend Russell(do I have a friend called Russell?).</p>
<p>To my surprise, Russell didn't tell me to turn myself in, and said something else, which I couldn't remember, and that's also the moment I woke up in the early hours just before the sun rose, feeling amused at my brain's capacity to create such a movie.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is how I got to live as a criminal for a few hours 😂</p>

With my graduation earlier this month, I have started to shift gears with regards to the way I live my life and how I spend my time.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Actually, I was en route to graduation in summer this year. However, due to poor planning and subpar academic results, I had to extend a semester in order to fulfil the programme requirements.</p>
<p>The transition from a student to a graduate who is ready to take on real world responsibilities is subtle, yet feels abrupt.<br>
A large contributor to this is the fact that I have not been spending my time wisely during my undergraduate years, such as engaging in activities that enriches the mind and heart, refreshes the spirit to become a more informed citizen who is ready to take on real life challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy learning</strong><br>
Interestingly, when I did a refresher on some of the core data structures and algorithms on my own, I actually took the time to understand them, and to appreciate some of their real life applications, which acts as positive reinforcements to fuel my interests in learning.</p>
<p>But the exact opposite were true during my undergraduate years when I was just studying for the sake of passing some timed tests, moving on to the next year, and eventually getting the degree.<br>
Result: No enthusiasm, lost, burnt out, depressed.</p>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Up till now, though I still do not have a clear idea of my career goals, the things that I want to achieve, I am grateful for the few work experiences that I have had last year and this year.</p>
<p>Every bit of experience broadens my perspectives in life and allowed me to realise the things that I value and wouldn't compromise on.</p>
<h3 id="thesoftwareengineer">The software engineer</h3>
<p>Being a software engineer is a natural by product of a Computer Science education.</p>
<p>As much as software engineers are frequently put on high pedestals, from being the guy who transforms coffee to code, to the know-it-all guy who can solve every problem that you can associate technology with, in reality there are a diverse range of us as well, just probably not as imagined.</p>

<p>It is no secret that software engineers are not the greatest communicators or eloquent speakers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I consider communication skill the top make-or-break factor in my career, especially daily work, one that overarches other areas such as technical prowess, salary and great company culture.</p>
<p>Personally, my technical skills AND communication skills are of average, nothing to shout at yet not too shabby.</p>
<p><strong>Communication when body language is missing</strong><br>
While I have encountered numerous difficulties and rejections that arise due to my technical competence, I have come to realise that the greatest stumbling block to my satisfaction and fulfilment at work is miscommunication among colleagues, which is greatly amplified in a <strong>remote</strong> team environment, and the management of these incidents.</p>
<p>This realisation came about because I had also made my own share of mistakes in communication in my previous workplaces. Minimising or eliminating communication overhead isn't a simple issue of &quot;making your intentions clearer&quot; and &quot;making sure everyone is on the same page&quot;.</p>
<p>What is clear is that as a (junior)software engineer, the onus is on us to keep abreast of the latest technological changes, continuous learning, being independent.</p>
<p>What is not straightforward is that when we encounter doubts, be it due to unclear requirements, lack of experience and therefore impeding accurate judgement, inconsistent or contradictory orders from superiors:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent should I ask for help?</li>
<li>Is it something that I can handle alone without letting the superior know?</li>
<li>Should I inform my indirect superiors in addition to the direct superiors and other team members to make sure everyone is on the same page?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are compounded by the fact that everyone, especially in a startup, is time-tight and do not have the luxury to sit down and give a 101 to doubts resolvers course.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>The communication decision tree</strong><br>
Here are a few rules of thumb that I follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>When starting out, it is better to err on the side of caution</li>
<li>Do not assume others know what you are thinking - let your thoughts be heard</li>
<li>Be resourceful(to realise when things don't tally) and confident enough to raise doubts to superiors and team members can sometimes prevent a huge wastage of time, not to mention motivation and morale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>I am glad that I got the opportunity to experience such dilemma because every doubt I face along the way allow me to hone my decision making skills and become a more effective person at work as well as in my private life.</p>
<p>Making mistakes are inevitable and often painful or even embarrassing, but it is only by picking ourselves up and moving on do we learn to become a better person.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>With all these, I am looking forward to a new year with clarity of thought and inner peace which lead to more proactive connections and opportunities.<br>
Onwards and upwards!</p>

<p>Imposter syndrome is the psychological behaviour that is characterised by a fear of being exposed as a fraud, and is widespread among the creatives, not just the coders.</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthishappen">Why does this happen</h2>
<h3 id="toandbeyond">To ∞ and beyond</h3>
<p>For one, I think we have the tendency to underestimate our abilities rather than overestimate them, especially for a junior developer. Given the broad field of computing, together with endless technologies, tools, frameworks, a person with the &quot;gotta learn em all&quot; mindset in order to feel successful or competent will inevitably find himself burned out before seeing through the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>In an industry that moves at breakneck speed, the constant pursuit of catching up with the latest trends has dampened our willpower to focus on what's important.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

<h3 id="eyesontheprize">Eyes on the prize</h3>
<p>Keep hustling, all is good, except only focusing on the outcome instead of enjoying the process.</p>
<p><strong>Chicken and egg?</strong><br>
If CS undergrads focus on the learning process rather than getting good grades, the knowledge and understanding will stick. If <a href="https://qr.ae/TUtFd3">exams</a> are good indicators of learning progress, then those that took extra time to appreciate and internalise the materials have done it right while the rest have it wrong.<br>
Of course, having a healthy balance of both is the best way ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Which camp do you belong to?</strong><br>
Generally the Computer Science(CS) community can be divide into 2 camps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The true CS evangelist(sometimes called elitists), advocating stellar competency in CS fundamentals such as networking, data structures and algorithms, discrete mathematics, etc.</li>
<li>The code implementor(sometimes called shiny tools chaser), advocating learning technologies and frameworks to solve business problems, without getting caught up in coding challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading some CS related threads on quora and reddit, a few of the most common problems CS undergraduates and fresh graduates faced are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to retain knowledge of data structures and algorithm</li>
<li>Motivation(Why) and approach(How) to study data structures and algorithm</li>
</ol>
<p>Answers to these questions depend on the advisors and can also be grouped into a few categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just practice more, always be coding, do and redo more programming practices via hackerrank, code chef, codewars, etc.</li>
<li>Don't memorise, internalise the knowledge by applying and practicing. &quot;If you have really learned the material well, you wouldn't be asking this question.&quot;</li>
<li>Try to relate learnings with real world examples</li>
</ol>
<p>With that, the learners are directed in a loop where almost nothing makes sense until everything clicked one day.</p>

  <figcaption>The grind continues</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="personalexperience">Personal experience</h2>
<p>At the start of my CS education, I could still remember the excitement I had when I was about to begin my education in an industry that shapes the future.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I couldn't exactly recall the reason why and how I lost the steam, but it was a combination of unrealistic self-expectations and competitiveness, optimising grades instead of learning, unable to relate lecture materials to the real world.</p>
<h3 id="thebreakingpointalmost">The breaking point, almost</h3>
<p>Despite numerous setbacks from attempts to get a decent handle at CS fundamentals, to be good enough to clear technical interview, and gotten into the cycle of bursts of motivation and despair, I have still not given up yet.</p>
<p>Though honestly I felt that I would be a happier person if I had just moved on, stay as an <em>average joe</em> developer that solves business problems with shiny tools, and forget about being a <strong>10x/rockstar</strong> developer.</p>
<p>However, a good contributing factor that led me hanging on was the fact that through some pure grinding, numerous revisiting of coding problems, I managed to have a little breakthrough in my knowledge that was absent during my 4 years as a CS undergraduate.</p>
<p>I am finally able to write recursive solutions to moderately challenging questions(skiing challenge), even though the code wasn't optimised - almost twice as long as others <span class="ec ec-open-mouth"></span></p>
<p>Indeed, things only become clear when looking back. Giving up doesn't make sense when I spent 4 years learning about learning, without the stresses of timed tests.</p>

<h2 id="donthatetheplayerhatethegame">Don't hate the player, hate the game</h2>
<p>The software engineer hiring ecosystem is set up such that a whole industry is created for technical interview coachings, which people have come to accept as the rite of passage of a truly competent software engineer.<br>
It is akin to a meritocratic society from which the educated and talented are rewarded.</p>
<p>However, it should be acknowledged that such a system has worked well for a long time and proven to stay competitive, despite side effects such as social stratifications, increasing strain on people further down the ladder.</p>
<h2 id="selfdiagonoseandmoderate">Self-diagonose and moderate</h2>
<p>We are constantly bombarded with information practically round the clock, therefore learning to tune out noise is an important skill for our overall well-being.</p>
<h3 id="emotionalandmentalcare">Emotional and mental care</h3>
<p>It is good to ask for advice and help, especially from seniors, close friends and mentors, but don't just go about hunting advice anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>The pattern of searching for help and advice <strong>excessively</strong> is not very far from the depression brought by social media. The negative aspects such as inadequacy and anxiety are likely to be the end product rather than the intended motivation, inspiration.</p>
<p>Don't let the frustration, fear and doubt be part of us when facing setbacks, be it unable to solve coding problems, making the mark for technical interviews, etc.<br>
When it comes, feel it, and <strong>let it pass</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="dosomethingmeanningful">Do something meanningful</h3>
<p>Find something that you enjoy doing that doesn't have an impact on your career and life. It could be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a personal website and design it to your liking</li>
<li>A project that you build out of genuine interest, not just for the sake of putting it on the resume.</li>
<li>Pick up a new hobby</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backtobasics">Back to basics</h3>
<p>Also, getting our lives in order is definitely beneficial. The simple things that we tend to overlook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat well. Not eat just about anything, but eat moderately, have a healthy relationship with food.</li>
<li>Rest well. Not just about getting 8 hours of sleep everyday, but have a wind down procedure/ritual before bed.</li>
<li>Mind well. Adopt a mindfulness practice. It could yoga, meditation, qigong, or any practice that cultivates spritual strength.</li>
<li>Socialise. Keep in touch with close friends, even more so after graduation. Look out for oportunities to connect with like-minded individuals.</li>
<li>Move. Be aware of posture throughout the day. Pick up a physical activity, which could be running, strength training, or sports.</li>
<li>Gratitude. Be grateful for what we have, than what we don't.</li>
</ul>

<p>I discussed some of the merits and drawbacks of using the ghost platform from my own personal experience. In this post, I will talk about the approach that I use to bring my ghost website from a localhost development environment to a live website hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, a static web host.</p>
<h1 id="whystaticwebsiteandwithghost">Why static website, and with ghost?</h1>
<h2 id="staticwebsite">Static website</h2>
<p>First, a static website is a website that consist of just a bunch of <code>HTML</code> files, together with <code>CSS</code> and <code>JS</code> assets.</p>
<p>Think of the olden days where websites display the same content to every user. Every time a new piece of content needs to be added to the website, they are manually written into the these files.</p>
<p>When a user visits your website, the relevant files are directly served to them without the need for a server to generate them on the fly because there is no database.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/static-vs-dynamic-website.jpg" width="400" alt="Hosting ghost blog as static website">
    <figcaption>Static vs dynamic website</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For many of us, we are looking for a website builder or system that allows us to create a blog and write posts, and that is a perfect usecase for a static website.</p>
<h2 id="prosandconsofstaticwebsite">Pros and cons of static website</h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p><strong>1. Security</strong><br>
A static website is generally safer than a dynamic website as there is no database to be cracked open. However, vulnerabilities do exist if 3rd party javascripts and dynamic features such as forms, payment gateway are used.</p>
<p><strong>2. Speed</strong><br>
Serving a static website is generally faster than a dynamic one, since there is no server to dynamically generate the web page.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cheap</strong><br>
There are numerous affordable options for hosting a static website, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/" target="_blank">Firebase Hosting</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Scalability</strong><br>
No dynamic website can beat any static website in terms of scalability. Once again, there is no database and application server for the case of a static website, all the web host does is to spit out the web page to visitors.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p><strong>1. Unintuitive workflow</strong><br>
Adding content to the website requires you to dive into <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>JS</code>, which could be overwhelming for the business executives or anyone who hasn't seen or heard of them before.</p>
<h2 id="whyghost">Why ghost</h2>
<p>For the case of hosting ghost as a static website, it functions more like a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/about" target="_blank">Static Site Generator(SSG)</a> with a <a href="https://headlesscms.org/about" target="_blank">headless CMS</a>.</p>
<p>Ghost offers a distraction-free writing experience with their simple and elegant admin panel, that is much simpler than wordpress.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is that there are fewer features out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="whynetlify">Why netlify</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are many options for hosting a static website.</p>
<p>Here are the features Netlify offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free web hosting plan</li>
<li>Continuous deployment with git</li>
<li>Automatic HTTPS setup</li>
<li>Add a custom domain with Netlify's DNS hosting</li>
<li>CDN to cache content around the world</li>
<li>DDoS protection</li>
<li>Load balancing</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, that is a lot of freebies right out of the box, for <strong>free</strong>! Don't you feel excited just by reading these? <span class="ec ec-money-mouth-face"></span></p>
<p>Next, let's run over the process of generating the static website and deploying it to netlify.</p>
<h2 id="therecipe">The recipe</h2>
<ol>
<li>Generate static website
<ol>
<li>Download an offline copy of the entire <em>yaphc.com</em> website</li>
<li>Download <code>sitemap.xml</code> separately</li>
<li>Fix internal links to point to the live domain</li>
<li>Fix <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> assets links</li>
<li>Use the https protocol instead of http</li>
<li>Prettify URL (optional)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deploy to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">netlify</a>, an incredible static web host, for free!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I have created a script to do generate a static website <a href="https://github.com/hanchiang/ghost-convert-static-website" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
The scripts are generously commented. Feel free to check it out and leave some feedback if you have any.</p>
<h2 id="hostingstaticghostwebsiteatnetlify">Hosting static ghost website at netlify</h2>
<p>First, we need to add a custom domain. Under <strong>Settings</strong> navigation menu, look for <strong>Domain management</strong>, and click on <strong>Add custom domain</strong>.<br>
Your domain will be added after a quick verification process.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/netlify-add-custom-domain.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hosting ghost blog as static website">
    <figcaption>Add a custom domain</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, enter the DNS panel of the primary domain.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/netlify-go-to-dns-panel.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hosting ghost blog as static website">
    <figcaption>Enter DNS panel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You will see a few Netlify nameservers. Add them to the custom DNS in your domain registrar.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/netlify-nameservers.jpg" alt="Hosting ghost blog as static website">
    <figcaption>Netlify nameservers</figcaption>

<p>For example, I am using namecheap and this is what it should look like.</p>

    <figcaption>Namecheap custom DNS</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="inclosing">In closing</h2>
<p>Ghost comes with an elegant user interface which allows us to write content peacefully. Hosting ghost as a static website is free and comes with other perks such as fast loading speed(SEO), more secure and able to handle huge traffc volumes if a post becomes viral overnight.</p>

<h2 id="thepositive">The positive</h2>
<h3 id="theeditorandadmininterface">The editor and admin interface</h3>
<p>Ghost 2.0 comes with a elegant and intuitive editor that makes the writing experience really pleasant.<br>
For writing, one should be focussed on the task at hand and not be distracted by the myriad plugins, settings and options.</p>
<p>HTML and markdown editors are also available for users who like to work with them.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

    <figcaption>Useful card blocks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The rest of the admin panel is also equally easy to work with.<br>
Adding a logo, site cover image, pages such as contact page and about page can't get any simpler.</p>
<h3 id="welldocumentedtheme">Well-documented theme</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper" target="_blank">Casper</a> is the default theme shipped with ghost. It is not only aesthetically pleasing, the documentation of the theme is excellent.</p>
<p>I am particularly impressed when I come across a product that is documented really well, well enough to onboard a new user to get started painlessly. This shows that the maintainers are not only competent, but they also care about creating products that people can actually understand and use alongside the website.</p>
<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>
<p>Another important aspect of running a personal blog is SEO. Ghost allows us to add custom post SEO meta data for search engines and facebook and twitter.<br>
<img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/meta.jpg" alt="Why blog with ghost platform?"></p>
<h2 id="thedrawbacks">The drawbacks</h2>
<h3 id="handlingimages">Handling images</h3>
<p>As awesome as the writing experience Ghost brings, it isn't without drawbacks.<br>
While the ghost experience from the perspective of a general user is extremely pleasant, certain options such as <strong>adjusting image size</strong> and <strong>serving scaled images</strong> are not quite apparent at first.</p>
<p>For the former, ghost automatically optimise images via lossless compression. If that isn't enough, specifiying <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attribute in an <code>img</code> tag is a quick way to resize image, though suboptimal.</p>
<p>For the latter, we can work with 3rd party image management providers such as <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/cloudinary/" target="_blank">Cloudinary</a>, or optionally have a read at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/automating-image-optimization/" target="_blank">image optimisation</a> for the performance champs.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of a media library, cleaning up images is a manual process.</p>
<p>As a software developer, I am able to navigate and work with the <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> files and modifying the asset bundling process without a lot of difficulty.<br>
It would be great if such common operations such as these are being communicated to users more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="thelowdown">The lowdown</h2>
<p>As a matter of fact, the best blogging platform largely depends on <strong>our needs</strong>. Therefore, we have to understand what kind of blogging experience we require in order to find a suitable platform to meet our needs.</p>
<p>For me, I am looking for a pleasant, distraction-free writing experience on the go without too much of a setup such as setting up page layouts, writing SEO meta data, which are usually shipped with SSGs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ghost platform fits my requirement nicely, and I am happy with it thus far.</p>
<p>Of course, SSGs produce static website, while a ghost blog isn't a static website.<br>
With a little bit of tinkering and hacking, I managed to convert my dynamic ghost blog with a node.js backend, into a static website and host it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>However, this is a subject for another time.</p>

<p>Bunyan is a nice tool that comes with great formatting for logging in production. It is easy to get started with, however customising its behaviour is not easy as the documentation isn't well organised to facilitate this.</p>

<img src="https://yaphc.com/content/images/2018/12/mongodb-logo.jpeg" alt="Managing connections in MongoDB"><p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows us to store data in other formats such as object, document, graph other than tabular relations using relational databases. As it is designed for horizontal scaling, NoSQL is increasingly used in applications that handle a huge volume of data, and real-time analytics.</p>
<p>Personally, I am using MongoDB out of interest, to learn a new technology and apply it to in my own side project. Like others, I followed tutorials and courses which used mongoose, a Object Document Mapper for MongoDB, to abstract nitty-gritty details away to provide a streamlined learning experience to new developers.</p>
<p>However, this time, I am using the <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/" target="_blank">native driver</a>, in an attempt to learn to use the actual MongoDB syntax and commands.<br>
So, the very first roadblock that I faced is to manage the connections, which mongoose already takes good care of.</p>
<h2 id="managingmongodbconnections">Managing MongoDB connections</h2>
<p>A quick research on StackOverflow and other websites suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to MongoDB when the app starts</li>
<li>Reuse the connection whenever the route handlers need to connect to the database</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds pretty simple. The next question I had in mind was: What is a good way to do this?</p>
<p>Another quick search showed a few approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to and store the MongoDB instance in <strong>req</strong> via an application level middleware before hitting the route handlers</li>
<li>Connect to MongoDB and pass the instance to the route handlers, which does so by exporting a function</li>
<li>Connect to MongoDB and store the instance. Route handlers and controllers that need access to the database will retrieve the instance</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="approach1storingmongodbinstanceinrequest">Approach 1: Storing MongoDB instance in request</h3>
<p>This approach is the easiest to implement.<br>
Set up a middleware that connects to the database, store the database instance in the request object, and use it in the route handlers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/floatdrop/express-mongo-db/blob/master/index.js" target="_blank">express-mongo-db</a> provides an example of how to do this.</p>
<p>However, I found out via StackOverflow that it might not be a good idea to expose library codes in an object.</p>
<h3 id="approach2passittoroutehandlers">Approach 2: Pass it to route handlers</h3>
<p>This approach is detailed by <a href="https://blog.mlab.com/2017/05/mongodb-connection-pooling-for-express-applications/" target="_blank">mLab</a>, one of the most popular MongoDB cloud providers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup up the connections in a config file and export the database instances.</li>

        // Note: A production application should not expose database credentials in plain text.
        // For strategies on handling credentials, visit 12factor: https://12factor.net/config.
        const PROD_URI = "mongodb://:@:,:/?replicaSet="
        const MKTG_URI = "mongodb://:@:,:/?replicaSet="

        function connect(url) {
          return MongoClient.connect(url).then(client => client.db())
        }

        module.exports = async function() {

<p>Even though this approach works, it won't be as clean for my case as my route controllers are defined in its own file, not in the route handler itself. Therefore, one additonal hoop is needed to apss the database instance.</p>

<p>These approaches achieve a common goal: To create a single connection instance that allows it to be reused.</p>
<p>The third approach does this in the simplest way that follows proper coding practices.</p>

<p>This is the code for my pie chart. I used the jQuery's selector to select my <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag, and call the <code>sparkline</code> function, passing in two arguments, an <strong>array</strong> of values and an <strong>object</strong> of options.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

</figure>
<p><strong>1. Values</strong></p>
<p>Put the values to be displayed in an array, which is passed in as the first argument to the <code>sparkline</code> function</p>
<p><strong>2. Labels</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, put the labels for the data in an array, which is to be used later in the tooltip</p>
<p><strong>3. Tooltip</strong></p>
<p>We use the <code>tooltipFormat</code> option to format out tooltip, and <code>tooltipValueLookups</code> option to provide the label to be displayed in the tooltip.</p>
<p>Everything in the span tag is used to display a small circle with the colour of the element, specified in <code>sliceColors</code>.</p>
<p><code>offset</code> is used to display the label name in the tooltip</p>
<p><code>{{value}}</code> displays the value of the element</p>
<p><code>({{percent.1}})</code> displays the percentage with one decimal surrounded by parentheses.</p>
<p>Besides writing simple code, the ease of customisation of the tooltip is an added bonus which provides a good developer experience.</p>
